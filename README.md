# garys-guide-scrape

this is an app that scrapes the job listings off of gary's guide. it was an exercise in scraping but it is useful to me since it removes some of the website's bloat. site can be found here: https://garys-guide.herokuapp.com/

## to run locally

navigate to the project directory and run `bundle install`. after that, run `ruby garys-guide.rb` and sinatra will start a local webserver. navigate to whatever the localhost address is *(usually it is `localhost:4567` by default)* and you are set!
